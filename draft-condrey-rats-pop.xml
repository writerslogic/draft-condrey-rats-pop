    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the Proof of Process (PoP) protocol, an
      evidence framework built on the IETF RATS architecture (RFC 9334)
      that enables tamper-evident, independently verifiable attestation
      of how digital content is produced. Rather than analyzing finished
      outputs, PoP captures cryptographically sealed behavioral evidence
      during the creation process, binding it to elapsed time through
      Verifiable Delay Functions and to device identity through hardware
      attestation.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an urgent
      need for mechanisms that can attest to the human authorship process
      of digital works. Current approaches such as watermarking and
      AI-detection classifiers operate on the finished output and are
      increasingly unreliable as generative models improve.</t>

      <t>This document specifies the Proof of Process (PoP) protocol,
      which takes a fundamentally different approach: rather than analyzing
      finished content, it captures tamper-evident evidence of the creation
      process itself. The framework builds on the IETF RATS architecture
      <xref target="RFC9334"/> and defines roles, evidence formats, and
      verification procedures for process-based authorship attestation.</t>

      <t>The key insight is that human authorship exhibits measurable
      behavioral characteristics -- typing cadence, revision patterns,
      pause distributions, error-correction sequences -- that are
      computationally expensive to fabricate in real time. By binding
      these behavioral observations to cryptographic time proofs, the
      framework creates evidence that is both tamper-evident and
      temporally authentic.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-conventions" title="Conventions and Definitions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-jitter-seal" title="Jitter Seal Mechanism">
      <t>The jitter seal binds evidence packets to the physical timing
      characteristics of the authorship environment, creating a
      non-transferable proof of temporal authenticity.</t>

      <t>The Attester captures inter-keystroke timing intervals at
      microsecond resolution. These intervals exhibit natural jitter
      from human motor control that serves as a behavioral entropy
      source. The jitter seal is computed as:</t>

      <t>seal = HMAC-SHA-256(device_key, timing_vector || T_difficulty || nonce)</t>

      <t>where T_difficulty is the VDF difficulty parameter that
      determines the minimum wall-clock time required to produce
      the seal.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-vdf" title="Verifiable Delay Function Mechanisms">
      <t>The Proof of Process framework employs Verifiable Delay Functions
      (VDFs) to bind evidence to elapsed wall-clock time. A VDF is a
      function that requires a prescribed number of sequential computation
      steps to evaluate, but whose output can be efficiently verified.</t>

      <t>This document specifies the use of repeated squaring in an
      RSA group as the VDF primitive:</t>

      <t>y = x^(2^T_difficulty) mod N</t>

      <t>where x is derived from the evidence packet hash, T_difficulty
      controls the time parameter, and N is an RSA modulus from a
      trusted setup.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-continuation" title="Continuation Tokens">
      <t>A continuation token provides cryptographic linkage between
      evidence collection sessions for the same document. This enables
      the Verifier to assess the complete authorship timeline even when
      the Attester's collection process spans multiple sessions.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-absence" title="Absence Proofs">
      <t>An absence proof demonstrates that no valid evidence chain exists
      for a claimed authorship period, supporting the detection of
      fabricated provenance claims.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-forgery" title="Forgery Cost Bounds">
      <t>The total cost of forging an evidence chain of duration D
      with n evidence packets is bounded by:</t>
      <t>C_total = C_vdf(n, T_difficulty) + C_entropy(n) + C_hardware</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-collaborative" title="Collaborative Authorship">
      <t>When multiple authors contribute to a single document, the Proof
      of Process framework MUST maintain distinct evidence chains for each
      contributor while enabling a unified verification of the composite
      work.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-trust" title="Trust Policies">
      <t>The Relying Party evaluates Attestation Results against locally
      configured trust policies. Four assurance tiers are defined (T1-T4),
      each requiring progressively stronger evidence.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>The Proof of Process framework collects behavioral evidence during
      content creation. Evidence packets MUST be constructed using the
      principle of data minimization as defined in
      <xref target="RFC6973"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security of the Proof of Process framework depends on several
      assumptions about the Attester's operating environment and the
      cryptographic primitives employed.</t>
