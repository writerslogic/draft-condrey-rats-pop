    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the Proof of Process (PoP) protocol for
      digital authorship attestation. It specifies the evidence collection
      state machine, semantic event definitions, cryptographic parameters,
      and Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) mechanisms that bind behavioral
      evidence to elapsed wall-clock time. The protocol builds on the IETF
      RATS architecture (RFC 9334) and defines the Attester, Verifier, and
      Relying Party roles for process-based attestation.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an urgent
      need for mechanisms that can attest to the human authorship process
      of digital works. This document specifies the Proof of Process (PoP)
      protocol, which captures tamper-evident behavioral evidence during
      content creation and binds it to cryptographic time proofs.</t>

      <t>This document is the protocol specification. A companion document,
      draft-condrey-rats-pop-appraisal, defines the verification procedures,
      forensic assessment mechanisms, and forgery cost analysis.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-conventions" title="Conventions and Definitions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-system-model" title="System Model">
      <t>The Proof of Process protocol maps onto the RATS architecture
      defined in <xref target="RFC9334"/>. The following entity roles
      are defined:</t>

      <section anchor="sec-system-attester" title="Attester">
        <t>The Attester is the software component running on the author's
        device that collects behavioral evidence during content creation.
        It operates the evidence collection state machine, computes
        cryptographic seals, and produces evidence packets. The Attester
        corresponds to the RATS Attester role.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-system-verifier" title="Verifier">
        <t>The Verifier receives evidence chains and produces Attestation
        Results. It implements the appraisal algorithms defined in the
        companion document. The Verifier MUST be operated independently
        of the Attester to prevent self-attestation.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-system-rp" title="Relying Party">
        <t>The Relying Party consumes Attestation Results to make trust
        decisions about content provenance. Examples include publishers,
        academic institutions, and content platforms.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-system-endorser" title="Endorser">
        <t>An Endorser provides supplementary attestations about the
        Attester's environment, such as hardware attestation certificates
        from platform vendors (e.g., TPM manufacturer certificates per
        <xref target="RFC9711"/>).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-system-compat" title="RATS Compatibility">
        <t>The protocol supports both the passport model (Attester sends
        evidence to Verifier, which produces result for Relying Party)
        and the background-check model (Relying Party forwards evidence
        to Verifier) as defined in <xref target="RFC9334"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-threat-model" title="Threat Model">
      <t>The following attack taxonomy identifies the threats that the
      Proof of Process protocol is designed to resist:</t>

      <section anchor="sec-threat-retype" title="Retype Attack">
        <t>An adversary manually retypes AI-generated content to produce
        fresh behavioral evidence. Defense: the protocol captures
        fine-grained revision patterns (editing, restructuring, pausing
        to think) that differ significantly from sequential retyping.
        The forensic assessment in the companion document detects the
        characteristic monotonic typing pattern of retyping.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-threat-replay" title="Replay Attack">
        <t>An adversary captures evidence from a legitimate authorship
        session and attempts to reuse it for different content. Defense:
        each evidence packet includes a content-hash binding to the
        specific document state, and session nonces prevent cross-session
        replay.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-threat-relay" title="Relay Attack">
        <t>An adversary relays evidence from one authorship session to
        claim credit for a different document. Defense: the content-hash
        chain binds evidence to specific content transitions, making
        relay detectable.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-threat-swf" title="SWF Acceleration">
        <t>An adversary uses specialized hardware (FPGAs, ASICs) to
        accelerate VDF computation, enabling faster-than-real-time
        evidence generation. Defense: the difficulty parameter is
        calibrated per-device, and hardware attestation at T3/T4 tiers
        binds computation to the enrolled device.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-threat-ae" title="Attestation Environment Spoofing">
        <t>An adversary spoofs the hardware attestation environment to
        bypass device identity checks. Defense: hardware attestation
        certificates are validated against manufacturer root certificates
        per <xref target="RFC9711"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-threat-diversion" title="Evidence Diversion">
        <t>An adversary redirects a legitimate evidence chain to claim
        authorship of different content by modifying the final content
        binding. Defense: the content-hash is included in every evidence
        packet (not just the final one), creating an incremental binding
        that cannot be diverted post-hoc.</t>
      </section>
