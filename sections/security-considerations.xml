<section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">

  <t>The security of the Proof of Process framework depends on several
  assumptions about the Attester's operating environment and the
  cryptographic primitives employed.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-security-attester" title="Attester Compromise">
    <t>If the Attester's device key is compromised, an adversary can
    forge evidence packets. Mitigations include:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Hardware-bound keys stored in a TPM or Secure Enclave.</t>
        <t>Key rotation with forward secrecy for evidence chains.</t>
        <t>Device attestation certificates issued by the platform
        vendor.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-security-replay" title="Replay Attacks">
    <t>An adversary may attempt to replay previously captured evidence
    packets. The VDF time-binding and session nonces prevent replay
    across sessions, but within-session replay is mitigated by the
    monotonic sequence numbers in each evidence packet.</t>
