<section anchor="sec-privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">

  <t>The Proof of Process framework collects behavioral evidence during
  content creation. This section addresses the privacy implications of
  such collection and the mechanisms employed to protect author privacy.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-privacy-data-min" title="Data Minimization">
    <t>Evidence packets MUST be constructed using the principle of data
    minimization as defined in <xref target="RFC6973"/>. Specifically:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Keystroke-level timing data MUST be aggregated into statistical
        summaries (mean, variance, entropy) rather than stored as raw
        event sequences.</t>
        <t>The Attester MUST NOT record the plaintext content of the
        document being authored. Only cryptographic digests of content
        state transitions are retained.</t>
        <t>Behavioral features MUST be quantized to prevent
        de-anonymization through stylometric analysis.</t>
      </list>
    </t>

  <section anchor="sec-privacy-continuation" title="Continuation Token Privacy">
    <t>Continuation tokens (<xref target="sec-continuation"/>) link
    evidence across sessions. To prevent tracking:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Tokens MUST be derived using HKDF (<xref target="RFC5869"/>)
        with a per-session salt.</t>
        <t>The Verifier MUST NOT be able to correlate tokens across
        different documents by the same author.</t>
        <t>Token rotation MUST occur at configurable intervals, with
        a RECOMMENDED maximum of 24 hours.</t>
