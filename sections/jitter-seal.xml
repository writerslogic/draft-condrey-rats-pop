<section anchor="sec-jitter-seal" title="Jitter Seal Mechanism">

  <t>The jitter seal binds evidence packets to the physical timing
  characteristics of the authorship environment, creating a
  non-transferable proof of temporal authenticity.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-jitter-capture" title="Timing Capture">
    <t>The Attester captures inter-keystroke timing intervals at
    microsecond resolution. These intervals exhibit natural jitter
    from human motor control that serves as a behavioral entropy
    source. The jitter seal is computed as:</t>
    <t>seal = HMAC-SHA-256(device_key, timing_vector || T_difficulty || nonce)</t>
    <t>where T_difficulty is the VDF difficulty parameter that
    determines the minimum wall-clock time required to produce
    the seal.</t>

        <t>Verifying the HMAC using the Attester's public key.</t>
        <t>Confirming that the VDF proof is valid for the stated
        T_difficulty parameter.</t>
