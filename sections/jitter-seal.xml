<section anchor="sec-jitter-seal" title="Jitter Seal Mechanism">

  <t>The jitter seal binds evidence packets to the physical timing
  characteristics of the authorship environment, creating a
  non-transferable proof of temporal authenticity.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-jitter-capture" title="Timing Capture">
    <t>The Attester captures inter-keystroke timing intervals at
    microsecond resolution. These intervals exhibit natural jitter
    from human motor control that serves as a behavioral entropy
    source. The jitter seal is computed as:</t>
    <t>seal = HMAC-SHA-256(device_key, timing_vector || T_difficulty || nonce)</t>
    <t>where T_difficulty is the VDF difficulty parameter that
    determines the minimum wall-clock time required to produce
    the seal.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-jitter-verify" title="Seal Verification">
    <t>The Verifier checks the jitter seal by:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Reconstructing the timing vector from the evidence packet.</t>
        <t>Verifying the HMAC using the Attester's public key.</t>
        <t>Confirming that the VDF proof is valid for the stated
        T_difficulty parameter.</t>
        <t>Checking that the timing entropy exceeds the minimum
        threshold for the claimed assurance tier.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-jitter-entropy" title="Entropy Requirements">
    <t>The minimum Shannon entropy for timing vectors is tier-dependent:
    T1 requires 2.0 bits/sample, T2 requires 3.0 bits/sample,
    T3 requires 3.5 bits/sample, and T4 requires 4.0 bits/sample.
    Vectors failing to meet the threshold MUST be flagged in the
    Attestation Result.</t>
