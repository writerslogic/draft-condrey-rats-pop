<section anchor="sec-vdf" title="Verifiable Delay Function Mechanisms">

  <t>The Proof of Process framework employs Verifiable Delay Functions
  (VDFs) to bind evidence to elapsed wall-clock time. A VDF is a
  function that requires a prescribed number of sequential computation
  steps to evaluate, but whose output can be efficiently verified.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-vdf-construction" title="VDF Construction">
    <t>This document specifies the use of repeated squaring in an
    RSA group as the VDF primitive:</t>
    <t>y = x^(2^T_difficulty) mod N</t>
    <t>where x is derived from the evidence packet hash, T_difficulty
    controls the time parameter, and N is an RSA modulus from a
    trusted setup. The proof pi enables verification in O(log T)
    time using Wesolowski's protocol.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-vdf-calibration" title="Difficulty Calibration">
    <t>The T_difficulty parameter MUST be calibrated to the Attester's
    hardware such that the VDF evaluation requires approximately the
    same wall-clock time as the evidence collection window. This
    calibration is performed during device enrollment and recorded
    in the device attestation certificate.</t>
