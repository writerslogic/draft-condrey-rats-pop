    <t>Alice writes a 500-word blog post over 45 minutes. Her PoP
    daemon collects 90 evidence packets (one per 30-second window).
    Each packet contains:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Typing cadence metrics: mean IKI of 180ms, variance 45ms^2.</t>
        <t>Revision events: 12 backspace sequences, 3 cut-paste operations.</t>
        <t>VDF proof with t_vdf calibrated to 30 seconds on her hardware.</t>
        <t>Content hash binding to the document state at window close.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>The Verifier confirms the chain of 90 packets spans 45 minutes
    of wall-clock time with consistent behavioral characteristics,
    producing a T2 (Standard) attestation result.</t>

    <t>Bob receives Alice's published document with an attached PoP
    evidence bundle. His verification process:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Parse the evidence bundle and extract the chain of packets.</t>
        <t>Verify each packet's HMAC and VDF proof.</t>
        <t>Check chain continuity via prev-hash linkage.</t>
        <t>Validate that the final content hash matches the published document.</t>
        <t>Assess behavioral entropy against configured thresholds.</t>
      </list>
