  <t>An absence proof demonstrates that no valid evidence chain exists
  for a claimed authorship period, supporting the detection of
  fabricated provenance claims.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-absence-types" title="Proof Types">
    <t>Three types of absence proofs are defined:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Computationally-bound:">Demonstrates that the
        T_difficulty parameter of the VDF proof would require more
        computation time than was available in the claimed authorship
        window.</t>
        <t hangText="Monitoring-dependent:">Relies on a trusted
        monitoring service that can attest to the absence of
        evidence submission during a claimed period.</t>
        <t hangText="Environmental:">Uses environmental signals
        (device sensors, network telemetry) to demonstrate that
        the claimed authorship context was not present.</t>
