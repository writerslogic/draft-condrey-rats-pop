<section anchor="sec-absence" title="Absence Proofs">

  <t>An absence proof demonstrates that no valid evidence chain exists
  for a claimed authorship period, supporting the detection of
  fabricated provenance claims.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-absence-types" title="Proof Types">
    <t>Three types of absence proofs are defined:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Computationally-bound:">Demonstrates that the
        T_difficulty parameter of the VDF proof would require more
        computation time than was available in the claimed authorship
        window.</t>
        <t hangText="Monitoring-dependent:">Relies on a trusted
        monitoring service that can attest to the absence of
        evidence submission during a claimed period.</t>
        <t hangText="Environmental:">Uses environmental signals
        (device sensors, network telemetry) to demonstrate that
        the claimed authorship context was not present.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-absence-construction" title="Constructing Absence Proofs">
    <t>To construct a computationally-bound absence proof, the Verifier
    calculates the minimum sequential computation time required for the
    claimed number of VDF proofs and compares it against the claimed
    authorship window. If the required computation time exceeds the
    window duration, the claim is demonstrably false.</t>
