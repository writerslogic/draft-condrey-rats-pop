<section anchor="sec-provenance" title="Provenance Links">

  <t>Provenance links establish a verifiable connection between
  the evidence chain and the resulting published content.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-provenance-binding" title="Content Binding">
    <t>The final evidence packet in a chain MUST contain a content
    binding that includes:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The SHA-256 hash of the final document content.</t>
        <t>A COSE_Sign1 signature over the content hash using the
        Attester's device key.</t>
        <t>The chain head reference (hash of the first evidence
        packet) to enable full chain traversal.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-provenance-publish" title="Publication Attestation">
    <t>When content is published, the publisher MAY act as an
    additional Endorser by co-signing the provenance link, creating
    a three-party attestation chain: Attester (author), Endorser
    (publisher), and Verifier (reader or auditor).</t>
