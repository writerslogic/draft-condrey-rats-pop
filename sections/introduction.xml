<section anchor="sec-introduction" title="Introduction">

  <t>The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an urgent
  need for mechanisms that can attest to the human authorship process
  of digital works. Current approaches such as watermarking and
  AI-detection classifiers operate on the finished output and are
  increasingly unreliable as generative models improve.</t>

  <t>This document specifies the Proof of Process (PoP) protocol,
  which takes a fundamentally different approach: rather than analyzing
  finished content, it captures tamper-evident evidence of the creation
  process itself. The framework builds on the IETF RATS architecture
  <xref target="RFC9334"/> and defines roles, evidence formats, and
  verification procedures for process-based authorship attestation.</t>

  <t>The key insight is that human authorship exhibits measurable
  behavioral characteristics — typing cadence, revision patterns,
  pause distributions, error-correction sequences — that are
  computationally expensive to fabricate in real time. By binding
  these behavioral observations to cryptographic time proofs, the
  framework creates evidence that is both tamper-evident and
  temporally authentic.</t>
