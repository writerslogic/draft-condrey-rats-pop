  <t>This section establishes lower bounds on the computational cost
  of forging Proof of Process evidence, providing quantifiable
  security guarantees for Relying Parties.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-forgery-model" title="Cost Model">
    <t>The total cost of forging an evidence chain of duration D
    with n evidence packets is:</t>
    <t>C_total = C_vdf(n, T_difficulty) + C_entropy(n) + C_hardware</t>
    <t>where:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>C_vdf is the cost of computing n VDF proofs sequentially,
        which cannot be parallelized below T_difficulty sequential
        steps per proof.</t>
        <t>C_entropy is the cost of generating synthetic behavioral
        data with sufficient entropy to pass statistical tests.</t>
        <t>C_hardware is the cost of obtaining a valid device
        attestation certificate (zero for software-only tiers,
        significant for hardware-bound tiers).</t>
