<section anchor="sec-compact" title="Compact Evidence Format">

  <t>For bandwidth-constrained environments, this section defines a
  compact evidence format that reduces the per-packet overhead while
  maintaining verifiability.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-compact-delta" title="Delta Encoding">
    <t>In the compact format, each packet after the first encodes
    only the differences from the previous packet:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Timestamps are encoded as millisecond deltas from the
        previous packet.</t>
        <t>Metrics are encoded as deltas from the running mean,
        using variable-length integer encoding.</t>
        <t>The content-hash is omitted when unchanged from the
        previous window (indicating a pause in editing).</t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="sec-compact-bundle" title="Evidence Bundle">
    <t>A compact evidence bundle wraps a complete evidence chain
    for a single document session. The bundle header contains:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The full first evidence packet (uncompressed).</t>
        <t>The total packet count and chain duration.</t>
        <t>A Merkle root over all packet hashes for random-access
        verification.</t>
        <t>A COSE_Sign1 signature over the bundle header using the
        Attester's device key.</t>
      </list>
