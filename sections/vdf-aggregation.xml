<section anchor="sec-vdf-agg" title="VDF Evidence Aggregation">

  <t>When evidence chains span extended authorship sessions, the
  cumulative VDF proofs can become prohibitively large. This section
  defines a succinct aggregation mechanism.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-vdf-agg-merkle" title="Merkle-Sampled Proofs">
    <t>Rather than requiring verification of every VDF proof in the
    chain, the Verifier MAY use Merkle-sampled audit proofs. The
    Attester constructs a Merkle tree over all VDF outputs in the
    chain and provides:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>The Merkle root of all VDF outputs.</t>
        <t>A random sample of k VDF proofs (where k is determined
        by the desired statistical confidence).</t>
        <t>Merkle inclusion proofs for each sampled VDF output.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>The Verifier checks the sampled VDF proofs and their Merkle
    inclusion, achieving probabilistic assurance over the entire
    chain with O(k log n) verification cost instead of O(n).</t>
