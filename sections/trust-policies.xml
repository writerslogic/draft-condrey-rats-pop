  <t>The Relying Party evaluates Attestation Results against locally
  configured trust policies. This section defines the policy framework
  for Proof of Process evidence.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-trust-levels" title="Assurance Levels">
    <t>Four assurance tiers are defined, each requiring progressively
    stronger evidence:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="T1 - Basic:">Software-only attestation with
        behavioral entropy above minimum threshold.</t>
        <t hangText="T2 - Standard:">T1 plus Sequential Work Function
        proof binding evidence to elapsed time.</t>
        <t hangText="T3 - Enhanced:">T2 plus hardware-anchored timing
        from a trusted execution environment.</t>
        <t hangText="T4 - Maximum:">T3 plus continuous device
        attestation and environmental sensing.</t>
