<section anchor="sec-collaborative" title="Collaborative Authorship">

  <t>When multiple authors contribute to a single document, the Proof
  of Process framework MUST maintain distinct evidence chains for each
  contributor while enabling a unified verification of the composite
  work.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-collaborative-model" title="Multi-Author Evidence Model">
    <t>Each author operates an independent Attester that produces
    evidence packets bound to their device identity. The collaborative
    evidence structure links these independent chains through:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>A shared document identifier derived from the initial content
        hash.</t>
        <t>Merge evidence packets that record when one author's changes
        are integrated into the shared document state.</t>
        <t>Cross-attestation signatures where co-authors acknowledge
        each other's contributions.</t>
      </list>
