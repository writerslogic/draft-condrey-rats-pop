  <t>This appendix provides guidance for integrating the Proof of
  Process framework with existing content management systems.</t>

  <section anchor="sec-integration-editors" title="Text Editor Integration">
    <t>Text editors and word processors can integrate PoP evidence
    collection through a local daemon process. The daemon:</t>
    <t>
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Listens for editing events via the editor's extension API.</t>
        <t>Aggregates events into evidence windows of configurable
        duration (RECOMMENDED: 30 seconds).</t>
        <t>Computes behavioral features (typing cadence, revision
        patterns, pause distributions) for each window.</t>
        <t>Seals the evidence packet with a Sequential Work Function
        proof and the device attestation key.</t>
      </list>
    </t>

  <section anchor="sec-integration-git" title="Version Control Integration">
    <t>For version-controlled documents, the PoP framework can attach
    evidence metadata to commits. Each commit message MAY include a
    reference to the corresponding evidence packet hash, enabling
    third-party verification of the authorship process for each
    committed change.</t>
