    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the appraisal procedures for Proof of
      Process (PoP) evidence. It specifies the forensic assessment
      mechanisms that evaluate behavioral authenticity, establishes
      quantified forgery cost bounds, and defines absence proof
      constructions. The document complements the PoP protocol
      specification (draft-condrey-rats-pop-protocol) by providing
      the Verifier-side algorithms and trust evaluation framework.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Proof of Process protocol (draft-condrey-rats-pop-protocol)
      defines how Attesters collect and seal behavioral evidence during
      content creation. This companion document specifies how Verifiers
      appraise that evidence to produce Attestation Results.</t>

      <t>The appraisal process encompasses three capabilities: forensic
      assessment of behavioral authenticity, quantified forgery cost
      analysis, and absence proof construction for detecting fabricated
      provenance claims.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-forensic" title="Forensic Assessment">
      <t>The forensic assessment evaluates the behavioral characteristics
      captured in evidence packets against models of human authorship
      behavior.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-forensic-snr" title="Signal-to-Noise Ratio">
        <t>The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measures the proportion of
        meaningful editing activity versus noise (random pauses, cursor
        movements without edits). A human authorship session exhibits
        characteristic SNR patterns that differ from automated generation.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-forensic-entropy" title="Behavioral Entropy">
        <t>The Verifier computes Shannon entropy over the timing
        distributions in each evidence window. Human typing exhibits
        entropy in the range of 3.0-5.0 bits/sample, while automated
        input typically shows lower entropy.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-forgery" title="Forgery Cost Bounds">
      <t>The total cost of forging an evidence chain is bounded by:</t>
      <t>C_total = C_swf + C_entropy + C_hardware</t>
      <t>where C_swf is the irreducible sequential computation cost,
      C_entropy is the cost of synthesizing realistic behavioral data,
      and C_hardware is the cost of compromising hardware attestation.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-absence" title="Absence Proofs">
      <t>Three types of absence proofs are defined: computationally-bound
      (VDF timing impossibility), monitoring-dependent (trusted service
      attestation), and environmental (sensor-based context disproof).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The appraisal mechanisms inherit the security properties of the
      underlying protocol. Additional considerations include verifier
      trust (the Verifier must be trusted not to fabricate Attestation
      Results) and threshold selection (entropy and SNR thresholds
      must be calibrated to avoid false positives and negatives).</t>
