    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the appraisal procedures for Proof of
      Process (PoP) evidence. It specifies the forensic assessment
      mechanisms that evaluate behavioral authenticity, establishes
      quantified forgery cost bounds, and defines absence proof
      constructions.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Proof of Process protocol (draft-condrey-rats-pop-protocol)
      defines how Attesters collect and seal behavioral evidence during
      content creation. This companion document specifies how Verifiers
      appraise that evidence to produce Attestation Results.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-conventions" title="Conventions and Definitions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-verification" title="Verification Protocol">
      <t>The Verifier MUST execute the following five-step verification
      procedure on each evidence chain:</t>

      <section anchor="sec-verify-chain" title="Step 1: Chain Integrity">
        <t>The Verifier validates that each evidence packet's prev-hash
        field matches the SHA-256 hash of the preceding packet. Any break
        in the chain indicates tampering or data loss. The COSE_Sign1
        signature on each packet MUST be verified against the Attester's
        public key.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-verify-temporal" title="Step 2: Temporal Ordering">
        <t>Timestamps MUST be monotonically increasing. The elapsed time
        between consecutive packets MUST be consistent with the SWF
        difficulty parameter (within 10% tolerance). For T3/T4 evidence,
        hardware-anchored timestamps are cross-validated.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-verify-entropy" title="Step 3: Entropy Assessment">
        <t>The Verifier computes Shannon entropy over the timing
        distributions in each evidence window. Minimum thresholds are
        tier-dependent: T1 requires 2.0 bits/sample, T2 requires 3.0,
        T3 requires 3.5, and T4 requires 4.0.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-verify-hmac" title="Step 4: Entanglement HMAC Verification">
        <t>The jitter seal in each packet is verified by reconstructing
        the HMAC from the timing vector, SWF difficulty parameter, and
        session nonce. This confirms that the behavioral data was
        captured by the claimed device.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-verify-state" title="Step 5: State Matching">
        <t>The final evidence packet's content-hash is compared against
        the published document's hash. Additionally, the Verifier checks
        that the content-hash progression across the chain is consistent
        with incremental editing (not bulk replacement).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-forensic" title="Forensic Assessment">
      <t>Beyond the five-step verification, the forensic assessment
      evaluates deeper behavioral characteristics.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-forensic-snr" title="Signal-to-Noise Ratio">
        <t>The SNR measures the proportion of productive editing activity
        versus noise. Human authorship typically exhibits SNR between
        0.3 and 0.7. Values above 0.9 suggest automated input; values
        below 0.1 suggest an idle session with injected events.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-forensic-clc" title="Compositional Lyapunov Coefficient">
        <t>The CLC with Incremental Kolmogorov Information (IKI)
        measures how writing complexity evolves over time. Human
        authorship shows characteristic CLC patterns: initial rapid
        composition followed by refinement phases. A monotonically
        increasing CLC without refinement dips suggests retyping.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-forensic-turk" title="Mechanical Turk Detection">
        <t>This mechanism detects patterns consistent with copying
        AI-generated content: large paste operations followed by
        minimal editing, unusually consistent typing speed during
        insertion phases, and absence of the characteristic
        think-type-revise cycle.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-forensic-errors" title="Error Topology">
        <t>The error topology analyzes the graph of error and correction
        patterns. Human writing exhibits complex error topologies with
        multi-step corrections, while automated input shows simpler
        patterns (single backspace corrections or no errors at all).</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-forensic-qr" title="QR Presence Challenge">
        <t>For real-time verification, the Verifier MAY issue a QR
        presence challenge that the Attester must scan and incorporate
        into the current evidence window, proving physical presence
        at the authoring device.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-forgery" title="Forgery Cost Bounds">
      <t>The total cost of forging an evidence chain is bounded by:</t>
      <t>C_total = C_swf + C_entropy + C_hardware</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-absence" title="Absence Proofs">
      <t>Three types: computationally-bound, monitoring-dependent,
      and environmental.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The appraisal mechanisms inherit the security properties of the
      underlying protocol.</t>
