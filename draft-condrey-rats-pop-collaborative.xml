    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends the Proof of Process architecture to
      support collaborative authorship scenarios where multiple
      authors contribute to a single creative work.  It defines
      mechanisms for multi-author evidence chains, merge attestation
      when parallel branches are combined, and cross-author
      verification that preserves the provenance of each contributor's
      work.  The extension enables Verifiers to determine exactly
      which portions of a finished work were authored by which
      individual.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Creative works are frequently produced by multiple authors
      working in collaboration.  The base Proof of Process architecture
      captures evidence from a single Attester device, but real-world
      authorship often involves parallel editing sessions, shared
      documents, and merge operations that combine contributions from
      different authors.</t>

      <t>This document defines the Collaborative Authorship Extension,
      which allows multiple Attesters to produce evidence chains that
      can be linked, merged, and independently verified.  Each author
      maintains their own evidence chain signed with their own device
      key, and merge attestations record the points at which
      independently-authored content was combined.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
      "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
      RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
      interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/>
      <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in
      all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Multi-Author Evidence Chains">
      <t>In a collaborative setting, each participating author operates
      an independent Attester that produces its own evidence chain.
      The evidence chains are linked by shared document identifiers
      and synchronized through merge points.  Each chain MUST be
      signed using COSE_Sign1 (<xref target="RFC9052"/>) with the
      respective author's device key.</t>

      <t>Authors are identified by their Attester public keys.  When
      a new author joins a collaborative work, the existing authors
      MUST each produce a co-authorship invitation record that
      includes the new author's public key and a timestamp.  This
      invitation record is included in every existing author's
      evidence chain to establish the point at which the collaboration
      began.</t>

      <t>Each author's evidence chain operates independently and does
      not require real-time synchronization with other authors.  The
      chains are linked only at merge points, allowing authors to
      work offline and reconcile their contributions later.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Merge Attestation">
      <t>When contributions from multiple authors are combined into a
      unified document, the merging party produces a merge attestation
      record.  This record contains the Merkle root of the combined
      document state, references to the head records of each
      contributing author's evidence chain, and a diff summary
      describing how the merge was performed.</t>

      <t>The merge attestation MUST be encoded in CBOR
      (<xref target="RFC8949"/>) and signed by the author performing
      the merge.  If automated tooling performs the merge, the
      attestation MUST still be signed by the device key of the
      author who initiated the merge operation.  The merge record
      includes a transparency log entry (<xref target="RFC6962"/>)
      commitment to ensure the merge cannot be repudiated.</t>

      <t>Verifiers validate a merge attestation by confirming that
      each referenced author chain is internally consistent, that the
      merged document state is a valid combination of the contributing
      chains, and that the merge signature is valid.  Cross-author
      verification requires access to the public keys of all
      participating authors.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Cross-Author Verification">
      <t>A Relying Party examining a collaboratively authored work may
      wish to determine the provenance of specific sections.  The
      cross-author verification procedure traces content through merge
      attestations back to the originating author's evidence chain.
      This allows attribution at the paragraph or sentence level,
      depending on the granularity of the evidence records.</t>

      <t>The verification algorithm walks the merge attestation graph
      in reverse chronological order, matching content hashes against
      individual author chains.  For content that was modified during
      a merge, the algorithm attributes the modification to the
      merging author while preserving the original authorship record
      of the base content.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Collaborative evidence introduces the risk of collusion,
      where multiple authors coordinate to fabricate evidence chains
      that appear independent.  The temporal binding provided by VDFs
      in the base specification mitigates this risk, as colluding
      authors would need to compute VDF chains in real time for each
      fabricated evidence record.  Verifiers SHOULD examine the timing
      patterns of multi-author chains for anomalies.</t>
